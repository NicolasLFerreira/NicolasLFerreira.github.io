            <p>This is not my first project, but the first one that I did for a real purpose (school presentation). This is a very
                simple platformer game where based on parkour where you can basically run, and the only threat is dying to the void
                if you fall.

            <h2>Padoru Wars</h2>
            <p>This is my first "big" project, and is basically a battle arena game where two players (same keyboard) have to fight
               till one hits the other's head and therefore, win. This game is very glitchy and mechanics are broken.
